Create a simple user management application using React and Flux.<br>
Acceptance criteria:<br>
  ● Displays a list of users using JSX<br>
  ● Can add and remove users<br>
  ● Can update existing user information<br>
  ● User info includes<br>
    ○ First name<br>
    ○ Last name<br>
    ○ Address<br>
  ● Has a basic UI (something more than unformatted text on a screen)<br>
User data should be maintained in the store, and modified through actions. It does not have to
persist outside of the application (no external JSON files or endpoints necessary).<br>
We’re looking for an understanding of:<br>
  ● How to use React’s state and props<br>
  ● The React and Flux lifecycles<br>
  ● ES6 Javascript<br>
The environment you use is up to you. Please make your code accessible through Git and be
prepared to share it with the team.
